The test problems are in the following format:

1) The Euclidean problems (*.pst)

120a, 201a, 240a, 300a, 360a, 39a, 39b, 39c, 39d, 39e, 42a, 42b, 45a, 45b, 48a, 48b, 510a, 51a, 51b, ch150, eil51, f21, f27, f33, f39, f99, krob150, man, pr1002, rat783, rat99, u1059

The x-y coordinates are listed and the finally a -1 stands for the end of the list.

2) The random problems (*.rnd)

x01-x20 (original random) and x01f-x20f (with triangle inequalities by shortest paths)

In the first row of the problem file, the number of points (n) are given. Then the entire costmatrix is coming, every row has n elements. The diagonal elements are zero.
